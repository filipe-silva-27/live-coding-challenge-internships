# Interview Live Coding - Java

## Overview

The Interview Live Coding challenge is a Java with Maven project that includes simple Java classes and exercises for you
to complete. The exercises cover different topics like object-oriented, data structures, and algorithms. The project 
aims to provide an interactive and engaging interview experience, allowing to showcase your Java and Spring 
Framework knowledge and coding abilities.

## Challenges

As part of this challenge we will evaluate you in the following topics:
- Language Fundamentals: core Java and Spring framework concepts, such as object-oriented concepts, exception handling, 
multithreading, design patterns, beans, dependency injection, and more.
- Spring framework Expertise: Spring concepts like dependency injection, inversion of control, Spring MVC and more.
- Problem-Solving: problem-solving abilities, algorithmic thinking, and overall programming skills.
- Design patterns: Singletons, Factory, or Observer to solve specific problems within the project.

## Requirements

To complete successfully the live coding interview, we expected to you have an Integrated Development Environment 
(IDE), ideally the `IntelliJ IDEA`, and the Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 installed.

It is essential that you have the required software and tools set up and tested before the live coding interview. This
ensures a smooth and efficient coding session and allowing you to focus on solving the challenges presented rather than
struggling with environment setup.
